## Path-Specific Recommendations

### For Data Analyst:

* Add CASE, COALESCE, NULLIF
* Learn dashboard-oriented formatting & casting
* Review pivoting (optional depending on BI tool)

### For Backend Python Developer:

* Learn CREATE TABLE, constraints, and indexes
* Use transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
* Master INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### For Data Engineer:

* Multi-layer query staging
* Incremental load patterns
* Partitioning and clustering
* Query planning tools (EXPLAIN, ANALYZE)
